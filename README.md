# Hello stranger 👋 Welcome to my world. Feel free to have a look around my projects and works
### Who are you?
#### My name is Athul Prakash. I am 16 year old cyber security engineer at hackerone. I currently work for many private programs as well as public ones. I've been in the field of computer science for almost 6 years (at the time of writing) and had really gone through a lot. My experience made me who I am right now.

#### I am self learner and learned everything without spending a penny. I know that sounds weird but I believe that if you really wanted something, theres nothing to stop you.
### What do you do?
#### Anything! I love to challange myself and create the impossible. Since my child hood I believed that `If You Hit A Wall, You Push Through It!`. And thats how I learnt everything I currently know and how I would learn something.

### Well what do you know?
#### Almost anything related to computers. By the age of 14, I learnt:
* Networking
* Batch scripting
* Bash scripting
* Python Development (especially automation)
* Html5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* SQL DB
* Web Application Security
* Penetration Testing
* Network Security
* Windows and Linux Kernal Testing


### What do you do now?
#### Learning, of course. I never stop learning and I never quit. I will keep on going. 
#### Testing my skills playing CTF's, trying to make money from bugBounty, waiting for the pandemic to over.

### What are you interested in?
#### Anything related to security and networking. I also like back end development but NO FRONT END (Cause I am really bad at CSS making designs)

### How to contact you?
#### Use my private email if you have to and I would be glad to chat with you. [pschosherlock@gmail.com](mailto:pschosherlock@gmail.com)
#### OR you can find me on social medias
