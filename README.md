# Hello stranger 👋 Welcome to my world. Feel free to look around my projects and works 🤗
### Who are you? 🧐
#### My name is Athul Prakash. I am 16 year old cyber security engineer at hackerone 👨‍💻. I currently work for many private programs as well as public ones. I've been in the field of computer science for almost 6 years (at the time of writing) and had really gone through a lot. My experience made me who I am right now.

#### I am self learner and learned everything without spending a penny. I know that sounds weird 😅 but I believe that if you really wanted something, theres nothing to stop you.
### What do you do?
#### Anything! 🤪 I love to challange myself and create the impossible. Since my childhood I believed that _If You Hit A Wall, You Push Through It!_. And thats how I learnt everything I currently know and how I would learn something.

### Well what do you know?

### So what's next? 🤨
<hr/>
#### Learning, of course. I never stop learning and I never quit. I will keep on going. 😌
#### Testing my skills playing CTF's, trying to make money from bugBounty, waiting for the pandemic to over 😩.

### What are you interested in?
<br/>
#### Anything related to security and networking. I also like back end development but NO FRONT END (Cause I am really bad at CSS making designs 😬)
